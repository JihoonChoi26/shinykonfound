This is based on a threshold of 0.794 for statistical significance (alpha = 0.05). To invalidate an inference, 60 observations would have to be replaced with cases for which the effect is 0.",

Correspondingly the impact of an omitted variable (as defined in Frank 2000) must be 0.568 X 0.568 = 0.323 to invalidate an inference."
